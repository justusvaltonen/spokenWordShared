Inspecting album covers using spotify small view and crappy LCD. What makes things stand out? Does my taste in music affect?



  AlbumCovers		- Bad experiment, contrast between sources vary too much. Google gives shitty. Spotify in darkmode is epic
   Amorphis		- Very nice
   Anthrax		- Defining future of thrash albumcovers
   Astrix		- Whole psytranse as a genre does great stuff
   Bonobo		- Nice
   BreckerBrothers	- Out of the loop: ahead of time
   CypressHill		- No whitespace thanks. I know that these look better somewhere else than spotify. Love their art.
   deadmau5		- Great
   DreamTheater		- SystematicChaos, fuckit theyre all perfect
   DR-Feelgood		- Very nice artist
   DynamiteMC		- See all and also "All 4 Corners"
   Emancipator		- Icons
   FleetwoodMac		- Very good but not too much in your face. Look closer
   FooFighters		- Basic, but good. Look closer. Reflects their music
   FrankZappa		- Evolution in albums
   GamaBomb		- Correlates with their songs
   Genesis		- Found it! This is the source!
   GGcaravan		- Unknown music, but solid covers
   IllBill		- Art
   Incognito		- Same, still nice
   InFlames		- Somehow defined style for future bands. Colony == Game Over && ThrashAssault (ManiacAbductor)
   IronMaiden		- TrendSetters
   Jamiroquai		- Simple, icons
   JediMindTricks	- Not what you would expect
   JimiTenor		- Varies
   JudasPriest		- ImaginaryToken
   KingstonWall		- II
   Krafty Kuts		- Combo
   Kreator		- Style correlates with music. Combo of old / semi-old / thrash + HeavyMetal + Bit of artsy
   LaCokaNostra		- Same
   ManiacAbductor	- Ripoff of everything I like combined to one. Fucking love it.
   Mastodon		- Very trippy
   Muse			- Can I guess when from cover?
   Necro		- Incredible
   Non-Phixion		- Necro
   NotkeaRotta		- Style
   Paleface		- Solid all the way as one might expect from a visual artist.
   Pantera		- Why do I love such crap?
   PoetsOfTheFall	- Appealing
   Polyphia		- Inkstuff, details that only work if you know
   Queen		- NoGood
   QuincyJones		- The Dude. Special
   Rush			- A Farewell To Kings --> Claimed to be from 1978. Don't buy it, I mean must be fake. Band is awesome. PowerWindow
   Santana		- Detailed, hard to icon
   SkidRow		- Distinguished
   Slayer		- Not that great. Music delivers tho
   Soulfly		- Brazil
   StepsAhead		- StepsAhead
   StevieWonder		- Why the blind man has the great album covers like Songs In The Key Of Life

   TheOffspring		- Solid
   TheRoots		- Nice
   TheWho		- I don't like
   Tool			- Disgraceful to compress to an icon.
