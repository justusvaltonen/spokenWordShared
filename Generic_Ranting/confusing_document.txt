Sound of walking:
-Some time ago I was doing experimenting with sound again. What sound does walking make? Why are some dogs almost silent walkers?

While preparing for a football game, I went outside to get my senses to sharpen since I've fealt lazy the whole day.
Temerature:         OK
Vision:             OK
Smell:              Warning
Hearing:            Warning
Taste:              Warning
Touch:              OK
Feelings:           Undefined

Smelling is a bit harder in a cold weather. I do smell something, but it's not working at full power. Not so sure if there's much that can be done at this point. I close my eyes and start listening. -- Train spotted nearby. By the sound I'd guess smaller than avg with slow speed. --! Wait, what? Today is a strike. No trains should be out. Whatever, I might be going insane, but what's new. -- Aeroplane sound, someone walking up the stairs, someone walking on snow. I turn around to see the person walking and realize that the distance I was able to spot that person is very close. --! When the man passes me I can clearly hear the sounds. Almost as if there is an invisible wall that I can't hear over. Starting to listen again... -- Someone closing, by the sound the person is walking on the slushy part of the road, since the sound is different. --! I open my eyes and see there were 2 people instead of 1. How did I miss this? Well it seems that senses are not the thing that I should rely on in todays game. The 2 people did walk synchronized that enabled the fooling of my hearing. There are plenty of experiments done with synchronizing effects. There is a term for it that I already forgot. Once someone asked me: "If there is wind in the forest, does the wind move the leaves if nobody is listening?".

Now it's time to go listen some music and finish up my coffee. I have some tricks up my sleeve to get myself in the mood. I will report later if I feel like it.

Smell of preparation:

I have trained myself or at least tried to train myself to get in to fight-mode by exposing myself to particular music and particular smell. In the wintertime all my senses seem to catch a drastic decline in sensitivity. Is there a way to introduce a smell through other means than our normal sensors? I already know that there is. This is the power of thinking. Some might call it imagination, but I'm not sure if they are one and the same. I have a game in 2h and I feel very lazy. I had my usual cup of coffee, but it's not kicking in for some reason. I shall try to get to this imaginary-land and see what happens. If I remember, I will log the results.
