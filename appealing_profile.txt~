-Go to repositories and create a new one. Make it public. Name needs to be the same as username.
-There was some advertised readme autogenerating tool. Dependencies were node and tailwindCSS at least.
-I found a new framework for Web-UI / WebDesign called gsap. Funny, but can get annoying if you want to get stuff done. Feels like little big planet.

-Wrote some generic text about what was going on inside my head at the time of writing.

-Another external himmeli was advertised called quine.sh. This wanted to gain access to my account when I visited the site. I think I'll pass.
-It offers something Reacty graphical things. Again not impressed enough to give up privacy.
-Still I get facinated by icons available in (1.3). Maybe it's time to get a life or at least have a break.
-Is it just me or am I being pressured to using different himmels and posting regulary? If one does, one may get a badge!!!!!

-I believe I'm supposed to do at least 2 different versions of my profile. I don't neccessarily want to recruit toddlers, but people may just be on LSD instead.
-Still my personal preference is using this pro-approach.

-Using someone elses code we want to:
1. fork ->      nasa-codebase and make your own version called my-nasa-codebase
2. clone ->     my-nasa-codebase to my local pc
3. edit ->      fix the thing with the airlocks
4. push ->      changes are put to my-nasa-codebase
5. pull         my-nasa-codebase sends the code to nasa-codebase
