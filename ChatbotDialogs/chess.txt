The London System is a popular chess opening that aims for a solid and flexible setup for White. It typically involves placing pawns on d4 and Nf3, controlling the center while preparing for a fianchetto of the light-squared bishop on g2. Here is an example of the starting moves of the London System:

    d4 d5
    Nf3 Nf6
    Bf4

In this opening sequence, White starts with 1. d4, controlling the central square d5, followed by Nf3, which supports the central pawn and prepares for the fianchetto setup. Black responds with 1... d5, mirroring White's central control, and 2... Nf6, developing a knight to a natural square.

Then, White plays 3. Bf4, aiming to place the bishop on the long diagonal from f4 to b8 after fianchettoing with g2-g3 and Bg2.

From this initial setup, both sides will continue their development, aiming for solid positions. The London System is known for its flexibility and can lead to various pawn structures and middle-game plans based on how both players continue their moves.

It's important to note that while the London System is a popular and effective opening choice, there are numerous possible move orders and transpositions that can arise, allowing for diverse gameplay and strategic possibilities in subsequent moves.
