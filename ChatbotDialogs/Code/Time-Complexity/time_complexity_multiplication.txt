Why is multiplication costly in computing?
ChatGPT

Multiplication is considered more computationally expensive than addition or subtraction due to the hardware complexity required to perform it, especially for larger numbers or in scenarios where precision and accuracy are critical. Several reasons contribute to the perceived costliness of multiplication:

    Hardware Complexity: Multipliers in computer hardware require more complex circuitry compared to adders. Multiplication involves breaking down numbers into smaller parts, performing partial multiplications and additions, and then summing these partial products to get the final result. This process involves more complex logic gates and circuits, increasing hardware complexity and potentially requiring more processing time.

    Number of Operations: Multiplication requires multiple addition and shifting operations, especially for larger numbers. For example, when using the standard algorithm for multiplication, each digit of one number is multiplied by each digit of the other number, and these partial products are then summed together.

    Bit Growth and Precision: Multiplication of large numbers can result in an increase in the number of bits needed to represent the result. This increased precision requires additional processing power and memory.

    Algorithmic Complexity: There are various algorithms for multiplication, each with different time complexities. Basic algorithms, like the standard schoolbook multiplication, have higher time complexity for larger numbers. Advanced algorithms, like Karatsuba multiplication or Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)-based multiplication, aim to reduce the number of operations and improve efficiency for large inputs.

    Resource Utilization: In hardware design, dedicating resources for a fast multiplier comes with a cost in terms of chip area, power consumption, and heat generation. Hence, trade-offs are made between speed, area, and power efficiency in processor design.

For these reasons, although modern processors have specialized hardware units for performing multiplication efficiently and quickly, multiplication remains relatively more resource-intensive compared to simpler arithmetic operations like addition or subtraction. However, advancements in hardware design and optimization, along with the use of specialized instructions in processors, have significantly improved the speed and efficiency of multiplication operations.

Why can't multiplication be done by using addition operations?
ChatGPT

Multiplication can indeed be done using repeated addition, which is the fundamental principle behind how early computers or simple machines performed multiplication. However, while feasible, this method is inefficient and impractical for larger numbers due to the significantly increased number of addition operations required.

Consider multiplying two numbers, 'a' and 'b', using repeated addition:

For example, to calculate 3 * 4:
3 * 4 = 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 12


This method works well for small numbers, but it becomes impractical for larger numbers or when dealing with large multiplicands. For instance, multiplying two 100-digit numbers using only addition would require performing the addition operation a massive number of times, which is highly inefficient and time-consuming.

Multiplication can indeed be thought of as a series of additions. For instance, multiplying 'a' by 'b' means adding 'a' to itself 'b' times. However, in terms of computational efficiency, using repeated addition for multiplication is highly inefficient, especially when dealing with large operands. Modern computer hardware utilizes dedicated multiplier units that employ more optimized and faster algorithms to perform multiplication in fewer steps than repetitive addition, significantly improving computational efficiency. These multiplier units utilize more complex circuitry and algorithms optimized for speed and efficiency, making them much faster and more practical than using basic repeated addition for multiplication.
