-Siivoile kaikki ennen postailua
-Tee gitignore tällekki repolle
-Game manuals
-Color analysis
-Music stuff
-Generative AI Studio
-Vertex AI
-Google Cloud Skill Boost
-12 days of no cost training to learn generative AI this December
-Google Bard
-Google translate           Sikahyvä
-Linkedin training
-Create lateral backups inside github and learn the basic usage
-Make some sense of the tokens. There is a lot of info to be found on the docs. Way too much for my liking. Once there is a need to use different methods, add a manual.
  --> Some of the tokens are just plain bad. Some are good. How to use on application level is a thing that could interest. Leaking data seems to become an issue very easilly.
  --> One thing is to automate refresh of cached creds. This is how happens in many protocols.
  --> I predict that I will find a way of doing things better in the near future.
-Clean the local versions of cheatsheets and remove extras. Backup first of course.
  --> Too much to ask and maintain. Just generally keep it tidy
-Feel free to improve the manuals any time. Maybe even integrating to readme could work
-Keep tree map available and updated at all times
    --> Alternative would be to use obsidian for example for better manual creation
    --> How to apply folder colors recursively. Can be done using a script, but seems like a task.
-Things relating to networking is a large topic that needs to be triplechecked. This is time consuming, but is good to do.
-Create your own styling guide to github. Use others as reference. What will my logo be? I need to explore colors first
-Some software that can analyze .png files would be nice. I would like to know howcome I like something.
-Rewrite you own fingerprint rules. Create the CLI-tool later. It may take some time. Have the program take in the settings as parameter so anyone can make their own language.
-Using banners can be a thing
-Automate file creator using CLI to add a template for manuals.
-Who/what is accessing my account?
    --> Possibly a webcrawler. I didn't know that I gave my consent.'
-Win the skills.github.com
-Create a vault of some sort. At least get credential.helper <custom> to work
-Create an easy way of migrating away from GH and other service providers. One should always have at least 2 providers occupied and 2 extra options waiting for a catastrophy
-How did the varials transfer again between apps? How about other data. I've had some problems with some excel format. Use many passpoints and alternative routes to move data
