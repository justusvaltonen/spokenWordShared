https://developers.google.com/products/     - Incredible amount of working full blown apps
https://mapsplatform.google.com/            - Looks like 200/m free $ to test their platform, not just maps
https://flutter.dev/                        - Candyland looking applications for simple use. Works with LCDs well
https://developer.chrome.com/docs           - There is a lot I don't know about chrome
https://www.tensorflow.org/                 - I don't know what to use this for. Still it doesn't matter

Firebase            == Android thing. Should be good
Flutter             == Template to create apps that know your resolution. Multiplatform
MapsPlatform        == I'm guessing they are after the same as PokemonGO
Tensorflow          == Generative AI that has pre-trained installations. Train your own AI by continuing from there. Hard as a tamagochi.
